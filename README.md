# The Oregon Trail

Spring 21 Project

This is an oregon trial video game as a project for the software development II students at marist college.
The purpose of this project is to teach students to code in CSS, HTML, JavaScript and deploy websites and servers.

## Usage

```bash
node server/oregonTrail.js
```

You have to travel a total of 500 miles and maintain the health of your players during the journey
which must be completed in 45 days.
Health is represented by a number between 0 and 100. You start with 100 health, different
things in the game will affect your health in both positive and negative ways, these include your
pace (how many miles your group travels in a day), the weather and if you take time to rest.
Your score at the end of the game will be determined by your group health level and the number
of days you finish ahead of schedule. If you do not complete the journey of 500 miles within 45
days your party will be lost in the snowy mountains and eat each other.
You can change your pace (steady, strenuous, grueling, resting) by pressing spacebar during
the game play and choosing a new pace.
